    "The NHL playoffs begin today and with it brings the celebrated tradition of people predicting playoff outcomes and other people yelling at them because their favorite team wasn't chosen as the likely champion. The team with the best record, by far, is the Washington Capitals and as such, are the de-facto favorite to win it all. I noticed recently that several people in the hockey stats world were pretty pessimistic about them; not only were they not projected to win it all, but they weren't even projected to come out of the first round. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was pretty interested by this anti-Capitals crowd (or more accurately, the pro-Flyers crowd), so I decided to download some data and play around with building some models. This little project got me thinking a bunch and I decided to share some things. My motivation for writing this post is two-fold: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. I think predicting playoff outcomes is a perfect example to highlight the differences between building models for understanding versus models for predictions. \n",
    "2. I saw several people claiming that a team other than the New York Rangers will win the Stanley Cup, and that made me really angry. \n",

    "Hockey is a relative new-comer in the application of statistics (lovingly called #fancystats in the hockey twittersphere) and is still in the growing pains of figure out what to do and how to it. This applies both to hockey teams and to fans and journalists. One common use of #fancystats is in support of a narrative about who will win a game. Let's take this article, <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/talent/the-nhl-playoffs-through-an-analytical-lens-1.470292\">   The Playoffs throug an analytics lens </a> as a case study. The general idea is to look at the advanced statistics for each matchup and use those numbers to inform a prediction about who is more likely to win the series. A few examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Offensively, it was the same story: the least shots generated [by the Chicago Blackhaws] of the Joel Quenneville era, creating just 54.0 shots for per-60.\" In support of the prediction that the Blackhawks will lose to St. Loius.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The goal rates are really worth noting, especially since almost all of Florida’s success there was driven by goaltending performance, not team shooting percentage. The former is a much more repeatable and pervasive talent, which means we can have a lot more confidence in their lofty goal differentials than we would in other teams around the league.\" In support of the prediction that the Panthers will beat the Islanders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that these arguments inherently rely on some <i>theory</i> about how hockey works. The first is a theory that shot generation (and relatedly, puck possession) is positively associated with winning. The second example has two theories: first that outstanding goaltender performance is a repeatable thing and second that outstanding shooting percentage (goals scored divded by shots taken) is not. All of these theories are perfectly reasonable ones that have solid logic (more shots obviously leads to more goals, which leads to more wins) and data (shooting percentage tends to regress to the mean) to back them up. They are all good ways to understand what goes into winning a hockey game. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretical explanations, however, are not necessarily the best tool for predicting future outcomes because understandable theories are generally too simple to be effective predictors. Higher puck possession is associated with more wins but by how strong is the relationship? Do puck possession statistics mean different things for different teams? Maybe teams with better goalies rely less on possession (Henrik Lundqvist could tell you a thing or two about that). Does shooting percentages regress to the mean for all teams, or are there some teams that shoot significantly better? In principle, we could throw all of these factors (and any other that you might think of) into a larger theory but as we make that theoretical model more and more complex, we lose the ability to interpret and understand what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain tasks where you don't care about understanding as your end goal and I want to argue that predicting outcomes is one of them. If some model tells me that the Rangers will win the Stanley Cup, I don't really care about why it thinks that. I'll want to know how accurate and reliable that estimate is but I'm not concerned about which statistics turn out to matter and which ones don't<sup>1</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "So my goal with this post is to show a small demonstration towards making playoff predictions using the best practices of predictive machine learning. By \"best practices\", I really just mean being very careful about evaluating our model. Since we are being so cavalier about what goes into the model and how it works, we need to think critically about how we train and what we get out of it. This involves making sure that we aren't inflating our accuracy numbers by simply predicing the past (<a href=\"https://statsbylopez.com/2015/05/20/85-is-a-unicorn-on-predictions-in-the-national-hockey-league-postseason/\"> looking at you, SAP </a>, [hat tip <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StatsbyLopez\"> @StatsByLopez </a>]) and ensuring that we aren't overfitting too much to the noise in our data. In machine learning parlance, this amounts to using held-out set for evaluating our model's accuracy and using a cross-validation/tuning loop to choose model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My language of choice of these things is Python, so here's the game plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get a bunch of game data from nhl.com using pandas (in a different notebook). \n",
    "2. Generate a bunch of features from that data, also using pandas. \n",
    "3. Use scikit-learn to build a model to predict game outcomes using the above data, making sure that we use all the nice regularization/tuning capabilities.\n",
    "4. Examine model performance on data that we held out while training the model (this prevents the predicting the past problem that SAP apparently has learned about). \n",
    "5. Use the model to make some predictions about this year's playoffs. \n",
